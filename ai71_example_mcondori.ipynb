            "Falcon: Yes, it is possible to use Streamlit with Python. Streamlit is a popular open-source framework for building data-driven web applications in Python. It allows you to create interactive dashboards, visualizations, and machine learning models with minimal coding. Streamlit is easy to use and provides a simple and intuitive interface for building web applications. You can use Streamlit to create a user-friendly interface for your image classification program and display the results in real-time. To get started with Streamlit, you can install it using pip and then create a new Python script with the Streamlit code. You can then run the script to launch the web application in your browser. Here's an example of how to use Streamlit to create a simple web application that displays a message:\n",
